ButtonImage

This application creates a new window with a single button in the middle that shuts down the
application when clicked.

What's Different
----------------

* The only difference in this sample comes in the window's XAML file where, instead of specifying
  a simple text string as the content of the button, we specify an image. The rest of the code is
  identical.
