    <!-- Within the window, place a 100x100 button. As in the previous sample, the width and height
         are explicitly specified while WPF positions the button in the center of the window.

         In this sample the content of the button will be slightly more complex so we use an
         alternate syntax to specify the content placing an image element in between an opening
         and closing button element. The "Source" property on the image specifies where to find
         the image file while the "Stretch" property defines if and how the image size is modified.
         By default, the image will be stretched to fit the button so we specify the value "None"
         so as to maintain the original image size. -->

    <Button Width="100" Height="100" Click="ButtonClick">
        <Image Source="Resources/close-icon-64x64.png" Stretch="None"/>
    </Button>
</Window>
