StockWindow

This first and simplest Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application creates and shows a new
empty window.

* The stock "Application" and "Window" classes are used directly.

* The window title is set via the "Title" property.

* The window is explicitly sized using the "Width" and "Height" properties while we let Windows
  choose the location.

* The window itself has no content and can only be closed by clicking the "x" in the upper right.
