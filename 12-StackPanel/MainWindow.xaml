    <!-- Begin the stack panel definition. The stack panel is a container element that allows
         child elements to automatically be arranged in a line that is oriented either horizontally
         or vertically. By default, a stack panel is oriented vertically which means that the
         elements within the panel will automatically arrange from top to bottom with no need for
         any additional positional information. -->

    <StackPanel Margin="8">

        <!-- Place a text block and a textbox in the panel.

             Note that with virtually no properties on these, they automatically arrange text block
             followed by textbox from top to bottom.

             Also note that the alignment opposite the stack panel orientation is always set to
             "Stretch". For example, since we're defining a stack panel oriented vertically, the
             horizontal alignment of the text block and textbox is "Stretch". -->

        <!-- Place a group box that we'll use to hold three checkboxes. The group box automatically
             places just underneath the textbox. We use an additional margin property only to put
             a little padding between the groupbox and the elements above and below it. We also use
             the "Padding" property to put a little padding inside the box. -->

                     information. We do add an additional right and left margin on each box only to
                     put a little padding between the checkboxes. -->
