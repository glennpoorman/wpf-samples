GridInButton

This application creates a new window with a single button in the middle that shuts down the
application when clicked. Instead of using a string or image as content, the button contains a
grid element. That grid contains two rows. The first row contains an image while the second row
contains the string "Close".

What's Different
----------------

* We define a 2x1 grid as the content of a button.

* The text block placed in the second button row introduces the "FontWeight" and "TextAlignment"
  properties. The font weight property does exactly what you would think setting the weight of
  the font display. The text alignment property is used to align the text within the element where
  as the regular alignment properties are used to align the element itself.
