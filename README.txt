WPF Samples

Glenn Poorman 2015

This is a collection of just a few simple samples showing use of the Windows Presentation
Foundation (WPF). These samples don't cover all or even half of what is available in WPF but
they should serve to give you an idea of what WPF is all about.

Note about the samples
----------------------

* Each sample contains a README.txt file that has a brief discussion of what the sample does and
  what new things are covered that were not covered in the last sample.

* In an effort to avoid a mile high pile of comments in the later samples, detailed comments on code
  repeated in later samples are removed or simplified down to one line. In other words, if you see
  some code you don't understand and it isn't commented or the comments are vague, chances are it
  is code that was introduced in an earlier sample and was heavily commented there.

* I am still in the process of learning WPF. If you see anything wrong, out of date, or something
  could have just been better, please feel free to let me know.

* Also if there are any explanations that seem confusing or need more detail, let me know about
  those as well.
