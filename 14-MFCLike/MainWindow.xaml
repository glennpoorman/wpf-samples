             text label "Scout Name" along with a textbox where the name can be entered/edited by
             the user.

             Note here that the textbox has been given a "Name" property. This name can be used in
             the code-behind to access the textbox element directly.

             Also note that we've specified an event handler for the "LostFocus" event. The event
             handler will be called whenever UI focus leaves the textbox and will copy the contents
             from the textbox into our data object. -->

             will be represented by a text label "Boxes Sold" along with a textbox where the number
             can be entered/edited by hand as well as two small buttons. One button to increment
             the number of sales by one and another for to decrement by one. -->

                <!-- Place the textbox. Again the textbox is given a name allowing us access to the
                     element in the code-behind and again we will catch the "LostFocus" event with
                     a custom event handler in order to copy data into our data object. -->

                <TextBox Name="soldBox" Width="60" HorizontalAlignment="Left" LostFocus="OnSoldLostFocus"/>

                <!-- Place two square buttons right after the textbox.

                     These buttons are used to add a sale to the tally of cookie boxes sold and/or
                     to subtract from the tally of boxes sold.

                     Each button has its own event handler assigned to the "Click" event so that it
                     can execute the operation for which it is intended.

                     The subtract button is named. This will allow us access to button element in
                     the code-behind and we'll use this access to enable or disable the button
                     depending on whether the sales total is zero or not.

                     Also note the use of the "IsEnabled" property in order to default the button to
                     being disabled. -->
