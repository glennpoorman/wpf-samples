AlignMarginPadding

This sample creates a new window with a single button aligned to the top left of the window that
shuts down the application when clicked.

What's Different
----------------

* The "Close" button is aligned to the top left corner of the window using the "VerticalAlignment"
  and "HorizontalAlignment" properties.

* With the alignments set top and left, the button automatically sizes so that it's just large
  enough for the content. Some extra space between the content and the button borders is added via
  the "Padding" property.

* Some space is added between the button and the window borders using the "Margin" property.
